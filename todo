 * auto-growing the BF sizes on reset based on statistic (number of updates vs number of 1s)
    * need to find a way to calculate the false positives
    * is it possible/useful to have a method mightContain(value, probability)
    
 * concurrency support for MBF
 * MBF should reset after some period (like every 10 seconds)
 * MBF builder to build the MBF to support some conditions, like:
    - only elements that were added 200 or more times in last 1 min
    - only elements that were added 2K times in last 10 seconds, assuming that more than 10K elements are added every 1 second
    - enable/disable auto-scaling
    - etc.
    
 * binary search for non-set BF
